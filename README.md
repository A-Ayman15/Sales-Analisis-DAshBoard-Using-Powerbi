Sales Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive Sales Analysis Dashboard designed to provide in-depth insights into business performance across various dimensions including Products, Categories, Regional Performance (State/City), and Time-based Trends.

The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable visualizations, enabling stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify top-performing areas, and pinpoint opportunities for profit optimization.

Key Metrics (KPIs)

The main landing page and subsequent views consistently track and display the following crucial metrics:

Metric

Description

Total Sales

The grand total of revenue generated.

Total Quantity

The total number of units sold.

Total Profits

The aggregate profit generated across all sales.

Total Orders

The total count of transactions processed.

Average Discount

The average discount rate applied to products.
